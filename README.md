# HolyC-Compiler

This project will be a compiler for the HolyC programming language created by Terry A. Davis for the TempleOS operating system.

## Future plans

- Write the compiler from scratch in C for ARM64 Assembly
- Rewrite the compiler in HolyC and bootstrap it using the first compiler
- Implement JIT compilation
